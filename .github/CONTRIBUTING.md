# Contributing

## Setup

Contributions are welcomed and greatly appreciated as they help to improve Hades
and add more features. To start contributing, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using `git clone
   https://github.com/JackAshwell11/Hades.git`.
2. Ensure [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) is installed.
3. Run `uv venv` and `uv sync` to install the dependencies needed to run the
   game. This will create a virtual environment in the `hades/.venv` directory.
4. Run `pre-commit install` to install the pre-commit hooks.

## Guidelines

Contributions should be made through
[issues](https://github.com/JackAshwell11/Hades/issues) and
[pull requests](https://github.com/JackAshwell11/Hades/pulls) and should use the
provided templates whenever necessary. Discussions on the contribution, its
uses, its needs and whatever else is necessary should be kept in the issue,
whereas, code reviews and implementation discussions should be kept in the pull
request.

A single pull request can close multiple issues, and a single issue can close
multiple pull requests as long as the amount isn't excessive. It is also
advised to stick to the items listed in the issue's task list as it can confuse
other contributors as to the purpose of the contribution.
